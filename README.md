## Introduction

This project explores the use of a deep neural network model (AlexNet) for identifying ripened fruits. The system integrates with a robotic system capable of picking fruits and sending notifications for ripened fruit.

---

## Architecture
The architecture consists of:
1. **Web Scraping**: Collect fruit images categorized as ripe, unripe, or rotten.
2. **Deep Learning Model**: Trains a neural network (AlexNet) on fruit images.
3. **Hardware Deployment**: The system uses Raspberry Pi to process data and send notifications.
4. **Notifications**: Ripened fruit notifications sent to mobile through the PushBullet API.
